# Dark Sky Stargazer's Tool 


## Mission Statement
Less than 100 years ago, everyone could look up and see a spectacular starry night sky. Now, millions of children across the globe will never experience the Milky Way where they live. The increased and widespread use of artificial light at night is not only impairing our view of the universe, it is adversely affecting our environment, our safety, our energy consumption and our health.
For three billion years, life on Earth existed in a rhythm of light and dark that was created solely by the illumination of the Sun, Moon and stars. Now, artificial lights overpower the darkness and our cities glow at night, disrupting the natural day-night pattern and shifting the delicate balance of our environment. The negative effects of the loss of this inspirational natural resource might seem intangible. But a growing body of evidence links the brightening night sky directly to measurable negative impacts including:

  - Increasing energy consumption
    It costs energy to produce light - excessive night lighting and inappropiate use of lighting wastes energy and money

 - Disrupting the ecosystem and wildlife
    According to research scientist Christopher Kyba, for nocturnal animals, “the introduction of artificial light probably represents the most drastic change human beings have made to their environment. Predators use light to hunt, and prey species use darkness as cover,” Kyba explains “Near cities, cloudy skies are now hundreds, or even thousands of times brighter than they were 200 years ago. We are only beginning to learn what a drastic effect this has had on nocturnal ecology.”
    Sea turtle hatchlings have been been dying by the millions in Florida, led astray by bright lights that they mistake for the birght hoirzon over the ocean.
    Birds that migrate or hunt at night navigate by moonlight and starlight. Artificial light can cause them to wander off course and toward the dangerous nighttime landscapes of cities. Every year millions of birds die colliding with needlessly illuminated buildings and towers. Migratory birds depend on cues from properly timed seasonal schedules. Artificial lights can cause them to migrate too early or too late and miss ideal climate conditions for nesting, foraging and other behaviors.

  - Harming human health
    Like most life on Earth, humans adhere to a circadian rhythm — our biological clock — a sleep-wake pattern governed by the day-night cycle. Artificial light at night can disrupt that cycle.
    Our bodies produce the hormone melatonin in response to circadian rhythm. Melatonin helps keep us healthy. It has antioxidant properties, induces sleep, boosts the immune system, lowers cholesterol, and helps the functioning of the thyroid, pancreas, ovaries, testes and adrenal glands. Nighttime exposure to artificial light suppresses melatonin production.


## Purpose
By creating this website, we hope to help promote awareness of the dangers of light pollution by providing the user a fun and interactive webiste designed to engage different aspects of stargazing. After all, stargazing is no fun with bright artificial lights shining down on you!

A website that allows the user to enter desired travel dates to determine optimal stargazing conditions - as defined by sunrise/sunset (length of dark sky) and phase of the moon.
The use can also select from a menu of various Dark Sky certified US National Parks and get more information on the individual parks. Parks are ceritfied by the Internaional Dark-Sky Association.
